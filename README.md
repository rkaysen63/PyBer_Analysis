Overview of the analysis:

The CEO of PyBer, a ride-sharing app company, has requested visualizations of ride-share data among different city types, to help determine ride-share access and affordability in underserved areas.  Cities were broken into 3 types:  Urban, Suburban, and Rural.   Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.

The purpose of the new analysis is well defined. (3 pt)
